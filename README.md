# Concord - C Discord API library

[ ![discord-shield][] ][discord-invite]
[ ![migrating-shield][] ][migrating-link]

## About

Concord is an asynchronous C99 Discord API library with minimal external dependencies, and a low-level translation of the Discord official documentation to C code.

### Examples

*The following are minimalistic examples, refer to [`examples/`](examples/) for a better overview.*

#### Slash Commands (new method)

*Note: you need to replace `GUILD_ID` with an actual guild ID, or this example won't compile!*
You can use a macro to do this: `#define GUILD_ID 1234567898765431`

```c
#include <string.h>
#include <concord/discord.h>

void on_ready(struct discord *client, const struct discord_ready *event) {
    struct discord_create_guild_application_command params = {
        .name = "ping",
        .description = "Ping command!"
    };
    discord_create_guild_application_command(client, event->application->id,
                                             GUILD_ID, &params, NULL);
}

void on_interaction(struct discord *client, const struct discord_interaction *event) {
    if (event->type != DISCORD_INTERACTION_APPLICATION_COMMAND)
        return; /* return if interaction isn't a slash command */

    if (strcmp(event->data->name, "ping") == 0) {
          struct discord_interaction_response params = {
                .type = DISCORD_INTERACTION_CHANNEL_MESSAGE_WITH_SOURCE,
                .data = &(struct discord_interaction_callback_data){
                      .content = "pong"
                }
          };
          discord_create_interaction_response(client, event->id,
                                              event->token, &params, NULL);
    }
}

int main(void) {
    struct discord *client = discord_init(BOT_TOKEN);
    discord_set_on_ready(client, &on_ready);
    discord_set_on_interaction_create(client, &on_interaction);
    discord_run(client);
}
```

#### Message Commands (old method)

```c
#include <string.h>
#include <concord/discord.h>
#include <concord/log.h>

void on_ready(struct discord *client, const struct discord_ready *event) {
    log_info("Logged in as %s!", event->user->username);
}

void on_message(struct discord *client, const struct discord_message *event) {
    if (strcmp(event->content, "ping") == 0) {
        struct discord_create_message params = { .content = "pong" };
        discord_create_message(client, event->channel_id, &params, NULL);
    }
}

int main(void) {
    struct discord *client = discord_init(BOT_TOKEN);
    discord_add_intents(client, DISCORD_GATEWAY_MESSAGE_CONTENT);
    discord_set_on_ready(client, &on_ready);
    discord_set_on_message_create(client, &on_message);
    discord_run(client);
}
```

## Supported operating systems (minimum requirements)

* GNU/Linux 4.x
* FreeBSD 12
* NetBSD 8.1
* Windows 7 (Cygwin)
* GNU/Hurd 0.9
* Mac OS X 10.9

*Note: big-endian processors running certain OSes like SPARC Solaris, PowerPC AIX, System Z z/OS or Linux, or MIPS IRIX are NOT supported. There are currently a few issues that prevent some of the logic from correctly on big-endian systems. This will be fixed soon.*

## Build Instructions

The only dependency is `curl-7.56.1` or higher. If you are compiling libcurl from source, you will need to build it with SSL support.

### On Windows

* Install **Cygwin**
* **Make sure that you installed libcurl, gcc, make, and git when you ran the Cygwin installer!**
* You will want to check the Windows tutorial [here](docs/WINDOWS.md)!
* Mingw64 and Msys2 are currently NOT supported. Please see [this](docs/MSYS2_MINGW64.md) for more information.
* Once installed, compile it normally like you would on UNIX/Linux/OS X/BSD.
* Note: you will likely need to include `-L/usr/local/lib -I/usr/local/include` on your `gcc` command, or in your `CFLAGS` variable in your Makefile for your bot.

### On Linux, BSD, and Mac OS X

*(note -- `#` means that you should be running as root)*

#### Ubuntu and Debian

```console
# apt update && apt install -y libcurl4-openssl-dev
```

#### Void Linux

```console
# xbps-install -S libcurl-devel
```

#### Alpine

```console
# apk add curl-dev
```

#### FreeBSD

```console
$ pkg install curl
```

#### OS X
* Note: you will need to install Xcode, or at a minimum, the command-line tools with `xcode-select --install`.
```console
$ brew install curl (Homebrew)
$ port install curl (MacPorts)
```

#### Arch Linux / Manjaro (Arch based)

```console
git clone https://aur.archlinux.org/concord-git.git
cd concord-git
makepkg -Acs
pacman -U concord-git-version-any.pkg.tar.zst
```

Alternatively, you can use an AUR helper:

```console
yay -S concord-git
```

## Setting up your environment

### Clone Concord into your workspace

```console
$ git clone https://github.com/cogmasters/concord.git && cd concord
```

### Compile Concord

```console
$ make
```

### Special notes for non-Linux systems

You might run into trouble with the compiler and linker not finding your Libcurl headers. You can do something like this:
```console
$ CFLAGS=-I<some_path> LDFLAGS=-L<some_path> make
```
For instance, on a FreeBSD system:
```console
$ CFLAGS=-I/usr/local/include LDFLAGS=-L/usr/local/lib make
```
On OS X using MacPorts:
```console
$ CFLAGS=-I/opt/local/include LDFLAGS=-L/opt/local/lib make
```
On OS X using a self-compiled libcurl:
```console
$ CFLAGS=-I/usr/local/include LDFLAGS=-L/usr/local/include make
```
On Windows with Cygwin, you might need to pass both arguments to use POSIX threading:
```console
$ CFLAGS="-pthread -lpthread" make
```

### Special note about linking Concord against another library
In some cases, you might want to link Concord into a shared object, or link it as a shared object into another shared
object. In that case, you will need to compile Concord with `CFLAGS="-fpic" make`. 

## Configuring Concord

[discord\_config\_init()][discord-config-init] is the initialization method that allows configuring your bot without recompiling.

The following outlines `config.json` fields:
```js
{
  "logging": { // logging directives
    "level": "trace",        // trace, debug, info, warn, error, fatal
    "filename": "bot.log",   // the log output file
    "quiet": false,          // change to true to disable logs in console
    "overwrite": true,       // overwrite file if already exists, append otherwise
    "use_color": true,       // display color for log entries
    "http": {
      "enable": true,        // generate http specific logging
      "filename": "http.log" // the HTTP log output file
    },
    "disable_modules": ["WEBSOCKETS", "USER_AGENT"] // disable logging for these modules
  },
  "discord": { // discord directives
    "token": "YOUR-BOT-TOKEN",         // replace with your bot token
    "default_prefix": {                 
      "enable": false,                 // enable default command prefix
      "prefix": "YOUR-COMMANDS-PREFIX" // replace with your prefix
    }
  },
  ... // here you can add your custom fields *
}
```
\* *Your custom field contents can be fetched with [discord\_config\_get\_field()][discord-config-get-field]*

## Test Copycat-Bot

1. Get your bot token and add it to `config.json`, 
   by assigning it to discord's "token" field. There are 
   well written instructions from 
   [discord-irc](https://github.com/reactiflux/discord-irc/wiki/Creating-a-discord-bot-&-getting-a-token)
   explaining how to get your bot token and adding it to a server.
2. Build example executables:
   ```console
   $ make examples
   ```
3. Run Copycat-Bot:
   ```console
   $ cd examples && ./copycat
   ```

### Get Copycat-Bot Response

Type a message in any channel the bot is part of and the bot should send an exact copy of it in return.

### Terminate Copycat-Bot

With <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>c</kbd> or with <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>|</kbd>

## Configure your build

The following outlines special flags and targets to override the default Makefile build with additional functionalities.

### Special compilation flags

* `-DCCORD_SIGINTCATCH`
    * By default Concord will not shutdown gracefully when a SIGINT is received (i.e. <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>c</kbd>), enable this flag if you wish it to be handled for you.
* `-DCCORD_DEBUG_WEBSOCKETS`
    * Enable verbose debugging for WebSockets communication.
* `-DCCORD_DEBUG_HTTP`
    * Enable verbose debugging for HTTP communication.

*Example:*
```console
$ CFLAGS="-DCCORD_SIGINTCATCH -DCCORD_DEBUG_HTTP" make
```

### Special targets

* `make shared`
    * Produce a dynamically-linked version of Concord. This Makefile is intended for GNU-style compilers, such as `gcc` or `clang`.
* `make shared_osx`
    * Produce a dynamically-linked version of Concord, for OS X and Darwin systems. 
* `make voice`
    * Enable experimental Voice Connection handling - not production ready.
* `make debug`
    * Enable some flags useful while developing, such as `-O0` and `-g`

## Installing Concord

*(note -- `#` means that you should be running as root)*

```console
# make install
```

This will install the headers and library files into $PREFIX. You can override this as such:
```console
# PREFIX=/opt/concord make install
```

### Included dependencies

The following are `stable` and well documented dependencies that are packaged with Concord and can be included to your projects:

| [jsmn-find](https://github.com/lcsmuller/jsmn-find)   | Tiny, zero-allocation JSON tokenizer               |

\* *Concord uses its own modified version that may be not up to date with the original*

Note that included headers must be `concord/` prefixed:
```c
#include <concord/discord.h>
#include <concord/log.h>
```

### Standalone executable

#### GCC 

```console
$ gcc myBot.c -o myBot -pthread -ldiscord -lcurl
```

#### Clang

```console
$ clang myBot.c -o myBot -pthread -ldiscord -lcurl
```

#### UNIX C compilers
##### This includes the following compilers:

* IBM XL C/C++ (AIX, z/OS, IBM i)
* Sun/Oracle Studio (Solaris)
* IRIX MIPSpro C++ (IRIX) -- NOTE: currently not supported
* HP aCC (HP-UX)
* Compaq C (Tru64 UNIX) -- NOTE: also currently not supported
*Note: if you want to actually compile this on one of the systems listed above, please see the "Compiling on old computers" guide.*

```console
$ cc myBot.c -o myBot -ldiscord -lcurl -lpthread
```

Note: some systems such as **Cygwin** require you to do this:
```console
$ gcc myBot.c -o myBot -pthread -lpthread -ldiscord -lcurl
```
(this links against libpthread.a in `/usr/lib`)

## Recommended debuggers

First, make sure your executable is compiled with the `-g` flag to ensure human-readable debugger messages.

### Valgrind

Using valgrind to check for memory leaks:

```console
valgrind --leak-check=full ./myBot
```
For a more comprehensive guide check [Valgrind's Quick Start](https://valgrind.org/docs/manual/quick-start.html).

### GDB

Using GDB to check for runtime errors, such as segmentation faults:

```console
$ gdb ./myBot
```
And then execute your bot from the gdb environment:
```console
(gdb) run
```
If the program has crashed, get a backtrace of the function calls leading to it:
```console
(gdb) bt
```

For a more comprehensive guide check [Beej's Quick Guide to GDB](https://beej.us/guide/bggdb/)
